# Place commands here to generate a trace with strace-gen.sh
#	one command per line, exactly like it would be entered
#	into the command prompt. The text file output will be
#	identified by the command name therefore the same prog
#	with separate arguments will attempt to overwrite the 
#	first.
#
# Comments must be on a separate line as the entire line is 
#	ignored if a # is found
